# JGriefGame

**Shipwrecked project**

In this game, I attempt to creatively gamify what it might feel like to go through the 5 stages of grief.

You play as The Griever, a character representing the emotional journey of someone facing grief.
Each level presents a unique gameplay experience, symbolizing one of the following stages:
1️⃣ Denial (Truth)
2️⃣ Anger
3️⃣ Bargaining
4️⃣ Depression
5️⃣ Acceptance
